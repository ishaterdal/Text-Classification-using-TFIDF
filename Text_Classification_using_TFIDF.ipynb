I asked the doctor to turn over my claim to his malpractice insurance company. This has cost me thousands of dollars to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am still trying to collect damages from this doctor. He never responded and turned over me to collections Merchants and Professional Collection Bureau , Inc. I sent them a letter describing exactly this issue and instead of not contacting me and verifying my debt they start reporting this debt to the credit reporting agencies. They never verified the debt, like I asked and they never stopped it from being reported when I specifically told them not to, due to the circumstances above.  ...
